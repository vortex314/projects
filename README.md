Project MQTT_SEQ : delivers a MQTT Client code usable on Linux and microcontrollers. It's based on extending the concept og javascript 'promise' to a 'sequence'.
Which is basicly a sequence of actions, which are specified upfront and to be executed in a certain order. 
This makes that the state machines and hierarchical state mchines are almost non-existent. The state is maintained in the code position itself ( not based on threads but on Adam Dunkels 
protothreads).
